2. Add source files by selecting a menu item in the menu that pops up with the right mouse button or dragging the necessary files from the explorer.
3. Select the destination folder for new files or leave the proposed one - the source files folder is used by default (if the file names match, the new files will be automatically assigned a numerical index).
4. Select format settings, codecs and their additional parameters.
5. Press the coding start button.

## Custom Build

1. First of all, you need to download or clone the source from the link https://github.com/SevenbytesSoftware/SevenConverter
2. To compile you need to open the file `SevenConverter\Seven Converter.sln` in the Visual Studio 2019 and run the Build.
3. Then you need to download the latest build of `FFMPEG` from site https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ and put the files in the `ffmpeg` subfolder next to the file obtained in the previous step `SevenConverter.exe`.
4. The program checks the presence of `FFMPEG` at startup and throws an error if they are absent.

## Localization
